# Platformer Game (SDL2 + ECS)

A simple 2D platformer built using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) in C++, featuring a custom Entity-Component-System (ECS), basic animation support, and two kinds of collision detection (AABB and per-tile collision). This project serves as a foundation for learning low-level game engine concepts and building modular systems in C++.
